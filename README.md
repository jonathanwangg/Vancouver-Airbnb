# Vancouver Airbnb

In this personal project, I do exploratory data analysis and machine learning to acquire a better understanding of the dataset and predict listing prices. I used multiple models and discovered that the best model I found was from using a Random Forest.

Data Source: http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html

Special thanks to my professor Mike Gelbart and TA Clement Fung for tips and suggestions on the dataset.
